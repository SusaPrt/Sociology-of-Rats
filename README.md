# Sociology-of-Rats
Progetto per il corso Simulazione Numerica
In this project we simulate the behaviour of rats in a confined space, as a function of the density. 
The system exhibits a phase transition from a situation in which rats are mostly calm to one in which they are mostly angry, which is a nice model for social behaviour in crowded social spaces.
